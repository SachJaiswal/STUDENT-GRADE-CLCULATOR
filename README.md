# STUDENT-GRADE-CLCULATOR

This project is a Grade Calculation Program written in Java. It allows users to input their grades for various subjects and calculates their final grade based on the scores provided. The program can be used to understand how different grading systems work and can be customized to support different grading scales.

## Features
- Accepts multiple subject scores as input from the user.
- Calculates the weighted average or final grade based on the input.
- Provides the final grade along with feedback (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
- Handles basic exceptions (e.g., invalid inputs).
